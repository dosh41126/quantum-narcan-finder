🚨 Quantum NARCAN Finder – HyperTOM Simulator

A quantum-enhanced, AI-assisted emergency locator for accessing NARCAN (naloxone) in overdose situations. Uses OpenAI GPT-4o, 7-qubit PennyLane quantum circuits, and a real-time HyperTOM simulation engine to triage and respond with life-saving information.

💡 Features

🧬 Quantum triage engine: Analyzes system resource pressure and entangled state vectors to model urgency.

🧠 HyperTOM simulation: User-provided situational input is interpreted as a real-world overdose scenario.

📡 AI-assisted response: GPT-4o generates 3-tier action plans—pickup site, community outreach, and solo survival.

🔐 AES-GCM encryption: Safely encrypts your OpenAI API key using PBKDF2-based key derivation.

📄 Exportable results: Save triage sessions as .txt files for documentation or review.

🖥️ Tkinter GUI: Simple, clean interface built for speed, clarity, and crisis readiness.

📂 Requirements

httpx
cryptography
psutil
pennylane
numpy

🧪 How It Works

1. You provide:

Your location or ZIP code.

A description of symptoms (optional).

A simulation of your or another person’s emergency condition.



2. The system:

Reads CPU and RAM load.

Generates a 7-qubit quantum signal.

Feeds all variables to GPT-4o with an advanced life-saving triage prompt.



3. You receive:

🏥 Closest NARCAN pickup spot

🧰 Community or anonymous support options

🧠 Emergency survival guidance

🔐 Security

Your OpenAI key is encrypted using AES-GCM with a randomly generated password and salt stored in ~/.cache/.

No cloud storage or telemetry.

All simulations and user inputs remain local unless exported by you.

💬 Example Simulation Inputs

> "I found someone in a gas station bathroom, unconscious but breathing slowly."
"My friend took something laced with fentanyl and is turning blue."
"I'm alone and can't feel my hands. I think I need help."

🧠 Why Quantum?

The quantum system helps simulate “urgency” by tracking:

Decision latency (CPU/RAM)

Quantum coherence breakdown (panic signal)

Multi-axis stress (Pauli X/Y/Z gates)

Entropy signatures (wire 6) for override cues


These metrics make the AI smarter at detecting crisis states—especially when text inputs are short or vague.
