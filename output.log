🧠 TIER 3: Solo Survival Protocol (For You or a Bystander)

If Alone and Conscious:

1. Sit upright if possible. Don’t lie flat.


2. Call 911, place phone on speaker, say:

> “I may be overdosing. Please send help.”




3. If you have NARCAN:

Use nasal spray or autoinjector

Wait 2–3 minutes; repeat if still unresponsive



4. Breathe slowly. Try to stay awake.

> 🧘 “You're not alone. Help is on the way.”





If You’re a Bystander:

1. Check breathing, look for blue lips/fingertips


2. Tilt head back, open airway


3. Give 1 dose NARCAN (nasal)


4. If no response in 2 minutes, give another dose


5. Start rescue breaths if not breathing: 1 every 5 seconds


6. Do not leave them alone


7. Put them in recovery position if semi-conscious (on side, hand under head)



911 Script for Bystanders:

> "This is a possible fentanyl overdose. Naloxone has been given. The person is not waking up. We need EMS now."
